# Setting up

## Installing

***Note:* You can use any installation method you like but you may need some extra setup!**

### Wally (Preferred)

add the following to your `Wally.toml`:
```toml
ActorUtils = "sebastian2852/actorutils@0.1.0"
```

Then run `Wally install` in your terminal to install the package.

Finally sync the created `Packages` folder in your Rojo project somewhere like `ReplicatedStorage`!


## Using

Once you have the package synced into your rojo project you can use all of its functionality in your game. See [API](../Api/ActorUtils) to see what you can do!
